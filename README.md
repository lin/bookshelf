More and more, I realize that my interests are lying between the foundation of mathematics and computer science.

I like to create stuff out of nothing by coding and designing and figure out the nature of things.

Intelligence, both artificial and educational, are core to my lifelong pursuit. Building a solver will be my next project when I succeed in online education, maybe five years later.

History is another topic that I am thrilled at, finding the patterns occurs in the past has a hugh impact to understand the current affairs and reduces the complexity of real world problems.
